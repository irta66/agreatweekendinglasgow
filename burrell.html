 <p><strong> HISTORY:</strong>
Originally a private collection owned by Sir William and Lady Constance Burrell in the early 20th century,
 the Burrells decided to donate their collection to the public. In 1944, they donated the entire collection 
 to Glasgow Corporation. The museum was built in Pollok Country Park, opening in 1983.</p>

<P> <strong>Renovation: </strong>A major refurbishment took place in 2016, with the museum reopening on 29 March 2022.</p>


<p><strong> Exhibits:</strong> The Burrell Collection contains global art pieces, including Chinese porcelain from the Tang Dynasty, 
Islamic antiques from the Mughal Empire, and medieval Gothic art.
It also holds one of the world's greatest collections of Degas' works.</p>
