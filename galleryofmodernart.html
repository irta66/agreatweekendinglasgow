  <p><strong>HISTORY</strong>
Opened in 1996 as the Gallery of Modern Art, the building itself contains a varied and interesting history.
 Originally built in 1778 as the townhouse for William Cunningham, a tobacco merchant who made his fortune 
 from the slave trade. It was sold to the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1817 and became Glasgow’s Royal Exchange,
  during which architect David Hamilton added the iconic Corinthian pillars. It was purchased by Glasgow 
  District Libraries in 1949 and began housing the city’s patents and commercial libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Exhibits:</strong>The gallery contains notable works such as the Tympanum, the mirrored room you enter the gallery, and art
 by famous artists like Warhol, Salgado, and Hockney. It offers a dynamic space for contemporary art.</p>
